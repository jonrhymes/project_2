<h1>GA Project 2: Springs.ly</h1>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>For my second project, I set out to build a mobile-first app that displayed real-time databases from APIs and could be queried.

I love to swim in beautiful Florida springs and I wanted a way to track the springs for any impulsive visit. 

The app is built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, JSX, CSS, HTML and Photoshop. It incorporates the MVC file structure and the 7 RESTful routes and it operates at full CRUD.
